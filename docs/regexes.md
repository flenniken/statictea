# Matches

Holds the result of a match.

```nim
Matches = object
  groups*: seq[string]
  length*: Natural
  start*: Natural

```


# getGroup

Get the first group in matches if it exists, else return "".

```nim
func getGroup(matches: Matches): string
```


# get2Groups

Get the first two groups in matches. If one of the groups doesn't exist, "" is returned for it.

```nim
func get2Groups(matches: Matches): (string, string)
```


# get3Groups

Get the first three groups in matches. If one of the groups doesn't exist, "" is returned for it.

```nim
func get3Groups(matches: Matches): (string, string, string)
```


# matchRegex

Match a regular expression pattern in a string.

```nim
func matchRegex(str: string; regex: Regex; start: Natural = 0): Option[Matches]
```


# matchPatternCached

Match a pattern in a string. Cache the compiled regular expression pattern.

```nim
proc matchPatternCached(str: string; pattern: string; start: Natural = 0): Option[
    Matches]
```

Match a regular expression pattern in a string.

```nim
func matchPattern(str: string; pattern: string; start: Natural = 0): Option[
