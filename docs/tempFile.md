# tempFile.nim

Create a temporary file.

Example:
~~~
import tempFile
var tempFileO = openTempFile()
require tempFileO.isSome
var tempFile = tempFileO.get()

tempFile.file.write("this is a test\n")
tempFile.file.write("line 2\n")
tempFile.file.close()

var fh = open(tempFile.filename, fmRead)
let line1 = readline(fh)
let line2 = readline(fh)
fh.close()

discard tryRemoveFile(tempFile.filename)

check line1 == "this is a test"
check line2 == "line 2"

# TempFile

Temporary filename and associated file object.

# TempFileStream

Temporary filename and associated stream object.

~~~

# openTempFile

Create an empty file in the temp directory open for read write. Return a TempFile object containing the filename and file object.  Call closeDeleteFile when you are done with the file.

~~~nim
proc openTempFile(): Option[TempFile] {.raises: [ValueError],
                                        tags: [ReadEnvEffect, ReadIOEffect].}
~~~

# closeDeleteFile

Close and delete the temp file.

~~~nim
proc closeDeleteFile(tempFile: TempFile) {.raises: [], tags: [WriteDirEffect].}
~~~

# openTempFileStream

Create an empty file stream in the temp directory open for read write. Return a TempFileStream object containing the filename and stream object.  Call closeDeleteStream when you are done with the stream.

~~~nim
proc openTempFileStream(): Option[TempFileStream] {.
    raises: [ValueError, IOError], tags: [ReadEnvEffect, ReadIOEffect].}
~~~

# closeDeleteStream

Close the stream and delete the associated temp file.

~~~nim
proc closeDeleteStream(tempFileStream: TempFileStream) {.
    raises: [Exception, IOError, OSError], tags: [WriteIOEffect, WriteDirEffect].}
