Write the stored command lines and the current line to the result stream and empty the stored commands.

```nim
proc dumpCmdLines(resultStream: Stream; cmdLines: var seq[string];
                  cmdLineParts: var seq[LineParts]; line: string)
```

# collectCommand

Read template lines and write out non-command lines. When a command is found, collect its lines in the given lists, cmdLines, cmdLineParts and firstReplaceLine. When no command found, return with no lines.

```nim
proc collectCommand(env: var Env; lb: var LineBuffer;
                    prepostTable: PrepostTable; resultStream: Stream;
                    cmdLines: var seq[string]; cmdLineParts: var seq[LineParts];
                    firstReplaceLine: var string)
