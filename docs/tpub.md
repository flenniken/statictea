# tpub.nim

The tpub macro pragma makes private routines public for testing. This allows you to test private procedures in external test files. When the test option is off, the macros do nothing.

# tpub

Exports a procedure or function when in test mode so it can be
tested in an external module.

Here is an example that makes myProcToTest public in
test mode:

~~~
proc myProcToTest(value:int): string {.tpub.} =
~~~~

```nim
macro tpub(x: untyped): untyped
```


# tpubType

Exports a type when in test mode so it can be tested in an
external module.

Here is an example that makes the type "SectionInfo" public in
test mode:

~~~
import tpub
tpubType:
  type
    SectionInfo = object
      name*: string
~~~~

```nim
macro tpubType(x: untyped): untyped
```
